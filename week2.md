# Week 2 Research Summary

## Git Research:

### GitHub vs. GitLab
I first researched GitHub vs. GitLab, which will help inform how I can use both platforms for my project. Here are some major findings:
- GitHub is a great public collaborative platform
- GitLab and GitHub both have tools for CI/CD Pipelines, but GitLab has had those tools longer and might be the better option for that element
- GitLab tends to be better suited for the entire DevOps lifecycle

### Logistics:
- The following source is a helpful tutorial for CI/CD Pipelines in GitLab: https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/quick_start/
- GitLab has a free version with a few limitations (400 compute minutes per month)
- I will continue to use GitHub for my website, and to source publicly available files to conduct code cleanup
