### Weekly Project Post Week 2

#### What did you do last week?

Last week I posted my initial idea for a project to piazza, from which I received useful feedback. I also spent some time going through the Git tutorial posted by another student to further familiarize myself with it. Additionally, I began looking for publicly-available Python and C++ files that I might be able to do some code cleanup for.

#### What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to install the Flake8 extension on VS Code, as well as cpplint and cppcheck. I also want to do research related to adding my own .config files for specific standards checks that I could create myself. Additionally, I would like to research CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab and possibly incorporate that into my project.

#### Are there any impediments in your way?

Time! I am taking two classes this semester and working full time, so I just need to be really mindful about meeting weekly due dates.

#### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I think I can be really specific about planning the tasks I need to complete each day. While I am trying to get everything done on weeknights, I may need to incorporate time on the weekends to get ahead during particularly busy weeks.
